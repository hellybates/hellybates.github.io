Hi, I'm Helena, a postdoctoral researcher at the Natural History Museum in London. I'm a planetary scientist, working with meteorites to understand more about the formation and evolution of our Solar System. 

I'm interested in matching the meteorites we have on Earth to their parent body asteroids still in space by linking lab data to telescopic and spacecraft observations. Most of my work is focussed on the meteorites and asteroids that look like at some point in their pasts they were exposed to water, because the questions about where water on Earth came from, and how it is distributed throughout the rest of the Solar System, have lots of implications for the development of life.

My background
------
I always loved space, and knew that if possible, that was what I wanted to focus on in my career. At school, I did chemistry, physics and maths at A level, with an AS level in biology. I then went on to study an undergraduate degree in [Geophysics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/geophysics-msci/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), starting in 2012. I studyed for 4 years and came out with an integrated master's degree. During my time at Imperial I did a project at the Natural History Musuem, my first experience working in a lab, and first time working with meteorites. I realised that working with real samples from space was exactly what I wanted to do, so during the final year of my degree I applied for PhDs in the field of meteoritics. I was lucky enough to be selected to do a PhD which was 'split-site', based at the [planetary materials group](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/earth-sciences/mineral-and-planetary-sciences.html) at the [Natural History Museum](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/), but working closely with the [space instrumentation group](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/space-instrumentation) at [Oxford University](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). 

After my PhD finished in 2020, I spent a year as meteorite curator at the Natural History Museum. During that time I was responsible for the management, organisation and conservation of the 5000 meteorite speimens in the collection. During my time as curator, the [Winchcombe meteorite](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq3925) fell, the first meteorite to fall and be recovered in the UK for 30 years, and I was partly in charge of the intial management and curation efforts.

Following my curation role, I moved back into research and since October 2021 I have been postdoctoral researcher, still based at the Natural History Museum - they can't get rid of me!

My work and research
------
I've got a number of projects that I am currently working on. 

I'm looking at the occurance of 'meteorites within meteorites' - certain types of meteorites have a high proportion of small clasts of other meteorite types embedded within them (we call these clasts xenoltihs). I am investigating what they are, where they are and where they might have come from.

I've also been investigating an interesting group of anomalous carbonaceous chondrites, including the C2-ungrouped Tagish Lake and Tarda meteorites. These rocks have an unusually heavy oxygen isotopic composition, high magnetite and sulfide abundances and different phyllosilicate compositions from other similar meteorites. I am trying to find more like them, potentially forming a new group of carbonaceous chondrites!


<!--Techniques-->
<!-- ------ -->
<!-- I use a variety of instruments and experimental techniques to do my research.-->
<!-- 1. *X-ray diffraction (XRD)*: This is a non destructive technique which investigates the crystalline structure of minerals. I primarily use powder XRD of complex materials (meteorites) to identify what minerals are present in the sample, and in what abundance. -->
<!-- 1. *Infrared (IR) spectroscopy*: This technique measures the interaction of infrared light with a material. There are a number of different types of IR spectroscopy which I use; diffuse reflectance spectroscopy can be collected from powdered meteorites, micro reflectance spectroscopy collects IR light reflected from solid samples like chips and thin sections, and emissivity can be collected from large amounts of powdered meteorites in specialised environmental chambers. -->
<!-- 1. *Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)*: This is a deceptively simple technique where the mass of a sample is monitored as it is heated to a high temperature. It allows us to measure the abundance and type of minerals which host volatile molecules, such as water. -->
