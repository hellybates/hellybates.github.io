2020-01-01	Linking mineralogy and spectroscopy of highly aqueously altered CM and CI carbonaceous chondrites in preparation for primitive asteroid sample return	Meteoritics and Planetary Science	We collected visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and mid infrared (MIR) reflectance spectra from well-characterized CM1/2, CM1, and CI1 chondrites and identified trends related to their mineralogy and degree of secondary processing.	<b>Bates, H.

2021-01-01	A Spectral Investigation of Aqueously and Thermally Altered CM, CM-An, and CY Chondrites Under Simulated Asteroid Conditions for Comparison With OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2 Observations	Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets	We report midinfrared (MIR) emissivity spectra (5.5–50 µm) obtained under ambient and simulated asteroid environment conditions and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra (2–5 µm) of CM and CY chondrite fine-particulate (<35 µm) powders for which bulk mineralogy was determined using X-ray diffraction.	<b>Bates, H.
