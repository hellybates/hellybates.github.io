title: "A Spectral Investigation of Aqueously and Thermally Altered CM, CM-An, and CY Chondrites Under Simulated Asteroid Conditions for Comparison With OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2 Observations"
collection: publications

excerpt: 'We report midinfrared (MIR) emissivity spectra (5.5–50 µm) obtained under ambient and simulated asteroid environment conditions and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra (2–5 µm) of CM and CY chondrite fine-particulate (<35 µm) powders for which bulk mineralogy was determined using X-ray diffraction.'
