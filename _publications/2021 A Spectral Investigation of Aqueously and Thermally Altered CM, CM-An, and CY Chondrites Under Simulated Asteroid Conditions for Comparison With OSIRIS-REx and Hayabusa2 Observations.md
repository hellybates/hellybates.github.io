collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Bates2021
excerpt: 'We report midinfrared (MIR) emissivity spectra (5.5–50 μm) obtained under ambient and simulated asteroid environment conditions and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra (2–5 μm) of CM
and CY chondrite fine-particulate (<35 μm) powders for which bulk mineralogy was determined using X-ray diffraction. '
